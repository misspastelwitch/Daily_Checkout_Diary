# Daily_Checkout_Diary

!! This is a work in progress!! 

This page is meant to make Daily Checkouts more interesting. 

I have ADHD, which makes keeping track of what I have done *very* boring. But what's worse than having to keep track of everything? Having to keep track with a boring, colourless document! I'm hoping that by working on this diary and making it look fun, I can motivate my brain to stop stealing my dopamine back, and in turn make it more rewarding to keep track of my progress as a student. 

At the moment, it only works for as long as you don't close/refresh the page. I thought of how I could fix this and came to the conclusion that I would need to use a backup server. A friend suggested Firebase, or Node.js, but so far neither have those are at my ability level, so I'm taking a break from this project for now to focus on getting good enough to turn this into a working site.
